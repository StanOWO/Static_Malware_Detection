# Malware Detection / Malware Classification
Purpose: Detect malware in MOTIF dataset using CNN.

To download MOTIF dataset: [click here](https://github.com/boozallen/MOTIF), or you an unzip **MOTIF.7z** in this poject.

# About our repository
The project is run in Python 3.11.4 and cuda version 12.3, package dependencies are stored in requirement.txt.

You should download the MOTIF dataset first, then run the code as follow in below:

1. **conversion_HW_v2.py**: 

   Turn binary executable into images
2. **classification_HW/data_Inspection.py**: 

   Downscale some classes (init: lower than 40 instances) and turn images into ImageFolder acceptable format.   

    - To get fimilair with ImageFolder, you can reference to [Pytorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/vision/main/generated/torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder.html)
4. **classification_HW/run.py**: 

   Train and test deep learning model.
   - dependency: **classification_HW/model.py**
  
    - dependency: **image_save_data**
   
        -> Our custom dataset. You can also use **classification_HW/data_Inspection.py** to create it on your own.

# Model result
We achieved an accuracy of 80.25% on our custom dataset 'image_save_data'.
